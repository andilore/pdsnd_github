# Exploring US Bikeshare Data with Python
This Python code explores data related to bikeshare systems for three major cities in the USA: Chicago, New York City, and Washington (**Note:** the .csv data files for the corresponding cities are _not included_ in the remote repository, as their files are too large).
The Python code imports the data and takes in raw user input to answer interesting questions about the data (via descriptive statistics), creating an interactive experience in the terminal.

### Date created
The project was finished on March 20, 2023.

### Files used
The data files used for the project were .csv files containing bikeshare data for Chicago, New York City, and Washington.  They were named aptly as chicago.csv, new_york_city.csv, and washington.csv, respectively. Remember: **these data files were _not added to the remote repository_, since they were too large in size**.
