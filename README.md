# Explore US Bikeshare Data

Here you will find Python code that allows you to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the US: Chicago, New York City, and Washington (**Note:** _the .csv data files from these cities have been omitted_ from the remote repository, as they are quite large).
The Python code imports the data and takes in user input to answer interesting questions about the data (via descriptive statistics), creating an interactive experience for the user in the terminal


### Date created
The project was created on March 20, 2023.

### Files used
The data files used were bikeshare data from Chicago, New York City, and Washington (aptly named chicago.csv, new_york_city.csv, and washington.csv, respectively).  Reminder: **these data files were not included in the remote repository**.

### Credits
Credit to Udacity for the fun project!
